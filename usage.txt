Options:
	-i <name>              Environment variable storing base64-encoded identity
	-I <file>              File storing identity
	[TODO] -k                     Disable trust checking
	[TODO] -t <client ID>         Trust this ID
	[TODO] -T <client ID file>    Trust all IDs in this file

Modes:
	gen: Generate new identity. It will be printed to stdout in raw form
		and to stderr in base64-encoded form.

	client <host> <port>: Connects to the specified host and port.
		stdin is sent and received data is printed to stdout.

	single <host> <port>: Starts a server that accepts a single connection.
		stdin is sent and received data is printed to stdout.

	multi <host> <port> <cmd> [args]: Starts a multi handler server.
		It will spawn cmd with args for each connection,
		pass received data to stdin and send data read from stdout.

	proxy: Starts a zeolite encryption/decryption proxy. Options:
		<listen-addr>  <listen-port>
		<connect-addr> <connect-port>
		<encrypt|decrypt>
	For each incoming connection on listen-addr:listen-port,
	it will connect to connect-addr:connect-port and either
	encrypt or decrypt traffic in that direction.
	Traffic coming from the connection will be inversely processed.
